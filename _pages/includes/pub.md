[TP-POCA: A MARL Algorithm for Target Defense Control of Non-Suicidal USVs in TAD Games](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8580-fastspeech-fast-robust-and-controllable-text-to-speech.pdf), **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, 
**Hengyu Hu**, Yueying Wang, Hai Wang, Kaizhou Gao, and Ning Wang.

- A target-defense task involving two opposing groups of non-suicidal unmanned surface vessels(USVs) and a target that is either time-invariant or time-varying is investigated for the first time.
- This article proposes a MARL algorithm that generates coordinated target-defense policies for teams of underactuated USVs by leveraging an attention mechanism for adaptive feature refinement and a prediction-based module for anticipating opponent and target behaviors.
- a whale‚Äìinspired reward mechanism is developed to model threat repulsion and target protection for underactuated USVs

[Cooperative Hunting Strategy for USVs Based on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558), 
**IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering**, 
Yueying Wang, **Hengyu Hu**, Huaicheng Yan, and Guanghui Wen.

- A novel reinforcement learning structure based on multi-head attention mechanism is proposed for the cooperative hunting game with partial observability and complex observation information.
- This article introduces a reward mechanism for the pursuer based on the threat potential field algorithm, using the potential field to describe the degree of threat to the evader during the pursuit process.
- An escape strategy based on the artificial potential field algorithm is designed,

[A novel efficient estimator for three-dimensional bearings-only source localisation with unknown sensor altitude and systematic measurement errors](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/rsn2.12520), 
**IET Radar, Sonar & Navigation**, 
**Hengyu Hu**, JiAn Luo, and Guanghui Wen.

- A novel 2S‚ÄêPMLE algorithm is proposed to address the SPAOSL problem efficiently when the angle measurements are subjected to systematic errors and the altitudeof the sensor platform is unknown;
- The Cram√©r‚ÄìRao lower bound is derived, and simulation studies are done by comparing the proposed algorithmwithother angle‚Äêonly source localisation algorithms. The simulation results corroborate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
